Program Layout and Functionality.
The application layout is divided into three main sections:
- Left: Product Groups.
- Center: Products belonging to the selected group.
- Right: Current Order (Cart Contents).
Each section supports scrolling independently.

Adding and Removing Items.
- Add to Cart: 
Click a product tile in the center section, 
or use the plus (+) button next to an item already in the cart.
- Remove from Cart:
Use the minus (-) button to decrease quantity.
To fully remove an item, click the garbage can icon 
next to it (the minus button does not remove the last unit).

Clearing and Completing Orders.
- Clear Order:
The garbage can icon next to the total amount clears the entire cart. A confirmation dialog will appear first.

- Pay:
Clicking the Pay button at the bottom opens a dialog that:
    - Displays the total amount,
    - Shows a visual wait indicator,
    - Gives the salesperson time to handle payment. The order is only cleared once “Payment Received” is confirmed.

All data in the app is mock data that is loaded when the
program opens.

I was thinking about adding more functionality to the
program, f.ex. a settings button somewhere, but I struggled
with where to put it. Also, I like when this primary UI is
clean, and doesnt have to much config buttons.
Another exe-file could access a config/setup program,
from where the primaty program could be administered.
F.ex. if more groups or products should be added, or the pricing
should be adjusted or if the program should be in dark mode,
or diskoteque mode, or some other flavours/designs, matching the
actual shop.
Also I was thinking about having some order history that
the sales person could pull out. But again it should not be
too complicated I thought.
Another thing that could be added by default was minor changes
to each product, and maybe some icons for the groups and the
products, but I didn't get to that.

I hope you like the program, anyways :)
