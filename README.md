***************************

To review and test the program:
1. Clone this repository to your local PC.
2. Inside the cloned repository, you’ll find a ZIP file containing the .exe (Windows) version of the program.
   - Unpack the ZIP file.
   - Double-click the .exe file to run the program on your PC.
3. You’ll also find an APK file for Android.
   - Copy the APK file to your Android device.
   - Install it to test the app on your device.

***************************

The layout of the program is separated in three sections:
  - To the left: Product groups
  - In the middle: Products for the selected product group
  - To the right: The contents of the current order
All three sections are scroll views.
Items are added to the cart by clicking the product tiles,
or by clicking the plus for items already in the cart.
Items are removed from the cart by clicking the minus or
or the garbage can at each cart item.
The minus cannot remove the list item, here the garbage can 
must be used.
The garbage can next to the total amount is used to clear 
the order, but it first presents a confirm dialog.
The Pay-button at the bottom, also first presents a dialog
when clicked, so the sales person have time to receive
money from the customer before the order is cleared.

************************

All data in the app is mock data that is loaded when the
program opens.

I was thinking about adding more functionality to the
program, f.ex. a settings button somewhere, but I struggled
with where to put it. Also, I like when this primary UI is
clean, and doesnt have to much config buttons.
Another exe-file could access a config/setup program,
from where the primaty program could be administered.
F.ex. if more groups or products should be added, or the pricing
should be adjusted or if the program should be in dark mode,
or diskoteque mode, or some other flavours/designs, matching the
actual shop.
Also I was thinking about having some order history that
the sales person could pull out. But again it should not be
too complicated I thought.
Another thing that could be added by default was minor changes
to each product, and maybe some icons for the groups and the
products, but I didn't get to that.

I hope you like the program, anyways :)
